Common Lisp Driver for riak using Protocol Buffers Client (PBC) interface


This is my attempt to write a Common Lisp driver for the
key-value-store Riak (http://basho.com/riak/) using their Protocol
Buffers Client (PBC) interface
(http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/references/protocol-buffers/).

It should be significantly faster than the HTTP-interface.
